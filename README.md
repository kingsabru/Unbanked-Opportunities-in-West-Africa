## Analysis

For easy visualization and analysis of the dataset, **Microsoft Power BI** is used to show the relationship between a factors that determine if a person has a bank account.

## Modeling

To build a classification model we tested the dataset with various classification machine learning models. Evaluating using Accuracy as a metric, the Forest Tree algorithm was selected for the model. The codes can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Power BI** - The visualization tool
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Scikit Learn** - The python framework
